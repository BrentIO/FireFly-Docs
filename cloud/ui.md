# Firmware Management UI

The firmware management UI is a Vue 3 single-page application (SPA) that provides a web interface for managing the firmware lifecycle.  It is served from a private S3 bucket via a CloudFront distribution.

## Features

- **Firmware list** — paginated table of all firmware records with sortable columns, text search across file name, product ID, version, and notes, and toggle filters for deleted and released firmware
- **Firmware detail** — modal view accessible directly via URL (`/firmware/:zip_name`) with all record fields, status transition controls, a lazy pre-signed download link, manifest file disclosure, and a delete button
- **Flash via USB** — browser-based firmware flashing over Web Serial directly from the firmware detail view (Chrome only; see [Flash via USB](#flash-via-usb))
- **Dark / light mode** — respects the system preference by default; user override is persisted in `localStorage`
- **Toast notifications** — success toasts auto-dismiss after 5 seconds; error toasts require manual dismissal
- **Confirmation dialogs** — destructive actions (delete, transition to RELEASED or REVOKED) require explicit confirmation

## Firmware Status

Firmware moves through a defined state machine.  The table below shows the display label for each status value.

| API Value | Display Label |
|---|---|
| `PROCESSING` | Processing |
| `ERROR` | Error |
| `READY_TO_TEST` | Ready to Test |
| `TESTING` | Testing |
| `RELEASED` | Released |
| `REVOKED` | Revoked |
| `DELETED` | Deleted |

### Valid Transitions

| From | To |
|---|---|
| `READY_TO_TEST` | `TESTING` |
| `TESTING` | `READY_TO_TEST`, `RELEASED` |
| `RELEASED` | `REVOKED` |

Transitions to `RELEASED` and `REVOKED` require confirmation.

## Default List View

The list defaults to showing only actionable firmware — records in `PROCESSING`, `ERROR`, `READY_TO_TEST`, or `TESTING` states.  **Show Deleted** and **Show Released** toggles are off by default and must be enabled explicitly to include those records.

## Flash via USB

The **Flash via USB** button appears in the firmware detail modal for any firmware record that has not been deleted. It is only visible in browsers that support the [Web Serial API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API) (Chrome and Chromium-based browsers). It is hidden in Safari, Firefox, and mobile browsers.

Clicking the button opens the flash dialog, which:

1. Downloads the firmware ZIP from the pre-signed S3 URL.
2. Extracts all flashable binary files from the ZIP.
3. Prompts the browser to open a port picker so you can select the device's serial port.
4. Connects to the ESP32 via esptool-js and detects the chip.
5. Writes each binary file to the device at its correct flash address.
6. Resets the device when complete.

### Flash Address Mapping

The flash dialog uses an explicit whitelist of recognised files. Only the files listed below are ever shown in the dialog or written to the device. Any other `.bin` file present in the ZIP — such as `sketch.ino.merged.bin` produced by ESP-IDF ≥ 3.3.7 — is silently ignored. This prevents new build artifacts from being flashed unintentionally when the ESP toolchain adds files to its output.

**Fixed addresses** — defined by the ESP32 architecture and the same on every board:

| File | Flash address | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `{application}.ino.bin` | `0x10000` | Main application binary (e.g. `Hardware-Registration-and-Configuration.ino.bin`) |
| `*.bootloader.bin` | `0x01000` | ESP32 bootloader |
| `*.partitions.bin` | `0x08000` | Partition table |

**Dynamic addresses** — resolved from the `partition_offsets` map stored in the firmware's DynamoDB record:

| File | Partition name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `www.bin` | `www` | Offset stored at ingestion time |
| `config.bin` | `config` | Offset stored at ingestion time |

When `func-s3-firmware-uploaded` processes a ZIP, it parses `partitions.bin` as a sequence of 32-byte ESP32 partition table entries (magic `0xAA50`) and stores the resulting name → offset map in the DynamoDB record as `partition_offsets`. The browser reads this field directly from the firmware record — no ZIP download is required just to determine flash addresses. This means the correct address is used automatically regardless of flash size or hardware revision, and no code changes are required when the partition layout changes.

**Excluded from display** — these file types are shown in the dialog as skipped (not flashed):

| Pattern | Reason |
|---|---|
| `*.elf`, `*.map` | Debug symbols — not needed on device |
| `manifest.json` | Upload metadata — not a flashable binary |

**Silently ignored** — these files are not shown in the dialog at all:

| Pattern | Reason |
|---|---|
| `*.merged.bin` (e.g. `sketch.ino.merged.bin`) | Combined image produced by ESP-IDF ≥ 3.3.7 — individual part files are flashed instead |
| Any other unrecognised `.bin` | Not part of the known flash layout |

### Erase All Flash

The flash dialog includes an optional **Erase all flash before writing** checkbox (off by default). When enabled, the entire flash chip is erased before any files are written. This is equivalent to the *Erase All Flash Before Sketch Upload* option in the Arduino IDE.

Use this option when:
- Flashing a device that previously ran firmware from a different project
- Stale partition data at old offsets needs to be cleared

Leave it off for routine firmware updates on devices that already have the FireFly partition table.

### Requirements

- **Chrome or a Chromium-based browser** — the Web Serial API is not available in other browsers.
- **USB connection** — the controller must be connected via USB.
- **Bootloader mode** — most FireFly boards auto-reset into bootloader mode via DTR/RTS when the serial connection opens. If your board does not reset automatically, hold the **BOOT** button while pressing **EN** before clicking **Connect & Flash**.

### Deleted Firmware

The **Flash via USB** button is not shown for firmware with a `DELETED` status. Deleted firmware has been removed from S3 and cannot be downloaded or flashed.

## Pre-signed Download URL

The download link in the firmware detail modal is lazy — the pre-signed URL is not fetched when the modal opens.  It is requested only when the user clicks **Download**, and it expires after 15 minutes.  See [func-api-firmware-download-get](./lambdas/func-api-firmware-download-get) for details.

## Infrastructure

The UI is hosted on AWS using two CloudFormation stacks:

| Stack | Description |
|---|---|
| `firefly-s3-ui` | Private S3 bucket for UI static files; no public access |
| `firefly-cloudfront-ui` | CloudFront OAC distribution with custom domain, HTTPS, and SPA routing (403/404 → `index.html`) |

## Deploying

The UI is built and deployed by the `deploy-ui-app` GitHub Actions workflow.  It requires the `firefly-s3-ui` and `firefly-cloudfront-ui` stacks to already exist.

The workflow:
1. Installs Node 20 dependencies (`npm ci`)
2. Builds the app with Vite, injecting `VITE_API_URL` constructed as `https://` + `API_DOMAIN_NAME`
3. Syncs the build output to the private S3 bucket (`aws s3 sync --delete`)
4. Invalidates the CloudFront cache (`/*`)

For first-time setup, use **Deploy All** (`deploy-all`), which handles the correct dependency order.

## Authentication

The login page is a stub — credentials are not validated against any backend.  Submitting the form sets a `firefly_authenticated` key in `sessionStorage` and redirects to `/firmware`.  The session is destroyed on logout (accessible from the hamburger menu) or when the browser tab is closed.
