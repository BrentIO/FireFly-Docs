# FireFly Cloud

FireFly Cloud is the serverless AWS backend that manages the Arduino firmware lifecycle.  It handles firmware uploads, validation, status progression, deletion, and over-the-air (OTA) delivery via an HTTP API backed by Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, S3, and CloudFront.

## Architecture

Firmware enters the system by being uploaded directly to S3, which triggers the upload Lambda to validate and register it.  The API Gateway exposes endpoints for querying firmware records, advancing their release status, and initiating deletion.  When firmware is released, binaries are published to a public S3 bucket fronted by CloudFront for device OTA delivery.  When firmware is revoked, the binaries are moved to a restricted prefix and the CloudFront URLs become inaccessible.

## Configurator UI

The Configurator UI is a cloud-hosted instance of the FireFly Controller web interface, built from the FireFly-Controller repository with `VITE_CLOUD_MODE=true`. It is served from a private S3 bucket (`firefly-configurator-s3`) fronted by a CloudFront distribution (`firefly-configurator-cloudfront`) at the `CONFIGURATOR_DOMAIN_NAME` domain. The `deploy-configurator-ui` workflow builds and syncs the assets from FireFly-Controller and is triggered by `repository_dispatch` from that repo when a new version is released.

## CloudFormation Stacks

The environment is composed of multiple CloudFormation stacks, each managed by its own deploy and delete workflow:

| Stack | Description |
|---|---|
| `firefly-acm` | ACM certificate for API Gateway, CloudFront, and Cognito custom domains (us-east-1) |
| `firefly-api-gateway` | HTTP API Gateway v2 with custom domain, access logs, and Cognito JWT authorizer |
| `firefly-dynamodb-firmware` | DynamoDB firmware table |
| `firefly-dynamodb-users` | DynamoDB allowed-list table for invitation-only access control |
| `firefly-cognito` | Cognito User Pool with Google IdP, pre-signup trigger, and super_users group |
| `firefly-func-cognito-pre-signup` | Pre-signup Lambda trigger that enforces invitation-only access |
| `firefly-func-api-users-get` | Users list endpoint |
| `firefly-func-api-users-post` | User invite endpoint |
| `firefly-func-api-users-delete` | User deletion endpoint |
| `firefly-func-api-users-patch` | Super user status endpoint |
| `firefly-func-api-appconfig-get` | Configuration page — logging configuration list endpoint (super user only) |
| `firefly-func-api-appconfig-patch` | Configuration page — logging configuration update endpoint (super user only) |
| `firefly-func-api-appconfig-post` | Configuration page — create new logging configuration application (super user only) |
| `firefly-s3-firmware` | Private S3 firmware bucket with lifecycle rules and event notifications |
| `firefly-s3-firmware-public` | Public S3 bucket for OTA firmware binary delivery; `revoked/` prefix is access-denied and expires after 90 days |
| `firefly-cloudfront-firmware` | CloudFront distribution fronting the public firmware bucket for OTA delivery |
| `firefly-shared-layer` | Shared Python Lambda layer |
| `firefly-func-api-health-get` | Health check endpoint |
| `firefly-func-api-firmware-get` | Firmware list and item retrieval endpoints |
| `firefly-func-api-firmware-status-patch` | Firmware status transition endpoint |
| `firefly-func-api-firmware-delete` | Firmware deletion endpoint |
| `firefly-func-s3-firmware-uploaded` | S3 upload event handler |
| `firefly-func-s3-firmware-deleted` | S3 delete event handler |
| `firefly-func-api-ota-get` | OTA firmware manifest endpoint |
| `firefly-func-api-firmware-download-get` | Pre-signed URL endpoint for downloading firmware ZIPs from the private bucket |
| `firefly-s3-ui` | Private S3 bucket for the UI static files |
| `firefly-cloudfront-ui` | CloudFront distribution serving the firmware management UI SPA |
| `firefly-configurator-s3` | Private S3 bucket for the Configurator UI static files |
| `firefly-configurator-cloudfront` | CloudFront distribution serving the Configurator UI SPA |

## Shared Lambda Layer

All firmware Lambda functions except `func-api-health-get` depend on `firefly-shared-layer`, a Python layer located at `lambdas/shared/python/shared/`:

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| `logging_config.py` | Configures JSON structured logging; log level driven by AppConfig |
| `app_config.py` | Fetches configuration from AWS AppConfig via the Lambda extension |
| `feature_flags.py` | Evaluates feature flags from AppConfig |
