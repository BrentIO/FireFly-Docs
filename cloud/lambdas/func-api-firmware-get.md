# func-api-firmware-get

## Description
Handles two read operations against the firmware DynamoDB table:

- **List** (`GET /firmware`) — returns all firmware records, optionally filtered by `product_hex` and/or `version`. The `files` array is excluded from list responses to keep payloads small.
- **Get** (`GET /firmware/{zip_name}`) — returns the full record for a specific build, including the `files` array. The `zip_name` (a UUID filename) is the unique identifier for a specific build, since the same product and version may have multiple builds from different commits.

When filtering by `product_hex`, the function queries a DynamoDB GSI (`product_hex-index`) for efficiency. All other filtering uses a full table scan, which is acceptable given the expected table size.

## Invocation
Invoked by **API Gateway** on an HTTP `GET` request to `/firmware` or `/firmware/{zip_name}`.
