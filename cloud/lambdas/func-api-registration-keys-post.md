# func-api-registration-keys-post

## Description

Generates a one-time device registration key and stores it in the `firefly-registration-keys` DynamoDB table. The key is a 6-character uppercase alphanumeric string with a 30-minute TTL. The caller shares the key with the person performing device registration — they enter it in the HW-Reg Cloud Registration screen. Each key can only be used once; it is consumed and deleted when a device registers successfully.

The key is stored alongside the generating user's Cognito sub and email address so that the registering device can record who authorized the registration.

Requires a valid Cognito JWT (any authenticated user).

## Invocation

Invoked by **API Gateway** on an HTTP `POST /registration-keys` request.
