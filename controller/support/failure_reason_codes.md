# Failure Reason Codes
Reason codes that can be raised by the hardware abstraction libraries to the main application.


## Inputs
Defined in `inputs.h`

| Enumeration | Code | Reason |
| ------------| ---- | ------ |
| `SUCCESS_NO_ERROR` | 0 | Request was successful, no error was returned | 
| `DATA_TRANSMIT_BUFFER_ERROR` | 1 | Data too long to fit in transmit buffer |
| `ADDRESS_OFFLINE` | 2 | Received NACK on transmit of address |
| `TRANSMIT_NOT_ACKNOLWEDGED` | 3 | Received NACK on transmit of data |
| `OTHER_ERROR` | 4 | Other error, raised by the I2C bus | 
| `TIMEOUT` | 5 | Timeout |
| `INVALID_HARDWARE_CONFIGURATION` | 10 | Invalid hardware configuration in hardware.h |
| `UNKNOWN_ERROR` | 11 | Unknown/undocumented failure |
