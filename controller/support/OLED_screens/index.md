# OLED Screens
The OLED display will show current status and configuration of the controller.

OLED screens are activated by pushing the front panel button.  When cycling through the front panel, the intro screen for each topic will be shown for a short period of time before the detail is shown.

A scrollbar is show on the right side of the display indicating where the user is in the sequence flow.
