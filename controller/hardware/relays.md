# High Voltage Relays
FireFly Controller supports both binary (on/off) and proportional (dimming) to be configured on every output port.

::: warning Check with local ordinances
Check with local ordinances about any requirements related to switching AC voltage and any requirements or permits that might be necessary.

::: info Always consult with a licensed electrician
Handling high voltage can cause injury or death.  Damage to property can occur if not installed and handled according to local laws and per the manufacturer's specifications.  Always consult with a licensed electrican.

# Solid State Relays
Solid state relays use light, rather than mechanical switches, to open and close the high voltage side of the relay using 0-5VDC proportional input control.  For binary relays, they will turn on at the minimum voltage and turn off below a minimum voltage when applying 5VDC.

The specific relays mentioned below have been pre-added to the Controller configuration database.

## Binary Controls
Binary controls come in two forms: traditional solid state relays and contactor relays.  Check with your local laws if one must be used over another.  However, a good rule of thumb is that if you are connecting a typical light circuit as the load, a standard relay is typically sufficient.  If connecting a motor (such as a fan or pump), a contactor relay should be used.

## Relay
[Crydom DR22 Series DIN Rail Mount SSRs](https://www.sensata.com/products/relays/dr22-series-din-rail-mount-ac-output-ssr-dr2260d20u) are reliable and can typically handle more load than found in a normal household lighting setup.  Refer to the datasheet to ensure you are meeting your specific electrical needs, but [`DR2220D20U`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrentIO/FireFly-Docs/main/controller/hardware/datasheets/DR2220D20U.pdf) is a good choice in North America and is C-UL-US approved.  These devices typically ship with a pre-installed heatsink.

Wiring on this device can be confusing; be sure to connect the correct voltage to the correct terminal.  Refer to the data sheet and [manufacturer's installation guide](https://www.sensata.com/sites/default/files/a/sensata-dr22-series-din-rail-mount-ssr-installation.pdf) for details.

5VDC from the FireFly Controller should be connected to A1 (+) and A2 (-).  Only two wires are needed from the Controller for this relay: `Red` (+) and `Black` (-).

## Contactor
[Crydom DR22 Series DIN Rail Mount SSRs](https://www.sensata.com/products/relays/dr22-series-din-rail-mount-ac-output-ssr-dr2260d20v) are reliable and can be used to power bathroom exhaust fans, small pumps, and other needs where a motor is (or could be) connected.  Refer to the datasheet to ensure you are meeting your specific electrical needs, but [`DR2260D20V`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrentIO/FireFly-Docs/main/controller/hardware/datasheets/DR2220D20U.pdf) is a good choice in North America and is C-UL-US approved.  These devices typically ship with a pre-installed heatsink.

Refer to the data sheet and [manufacturer's installation guide](https://www.sensata.com/sites/default/files/a/sensata-dr22-series-din-rail-mount-ssr-installation.pdf) for details.

5VDC from the FireFly Controller should be connected to A1 (+) and A2 (-).  Only two wires are needed from the Controller for this relay: `Red` (+) and `Black` (-).

## Proportional Control
Proportional relays allow a percentage of brightness from 0-100%.  In reality, proportional controls will usually be most noticeable between 10% and 90%.  FireFly Controller will automatically round down to 0% when brightness is set below 5% and round up to 100% when brightness is above 95%. 


::: danger Not all lights can be dimmed
Check with the manufacturer of the fixture to ensure it can be dimmed.  Many LED fixtures **cannot** be dimmed, or if they can be, require a particular type of dimmer.  If your fixture cannot be dimmed, or if you do not use the correct type of dimmer, **damage or fire may occur**.  

Crydom [`PMP2425W`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrentIO/FireFly-Docs/main/controller/hardware/datasheets/PMP2425W.pdf) proportional relays use a triac dimmer.  If you are not certain the dimmer type supported by the fixture **do not attempt to dim it**.
:::

[Crydom PMP2425W](https://www.sensata.com/products/relays/pmp-series-proportional-control-ssr-pmp2425w) is a good choice for dimming.  It uses 3 connectors to provide dimming on a 0-5VDC basis which is mapped from 0% to 100%.  This model typically _does not_ ship with a heatsink, which is required.  The [HS301DR](https://www.sensata.com/sites/default/files/a/sensata-hs301dr-heatsink-ssr-assemblies-datasheet.pdf) has been known to work well, but determine your own thermal needs based on installation location and cooling available.

When using this dimmer, ensure the switch is set to `A`.  Wires at both the relay and the Controller should be `Red` (V), `Green` (+), `Black` (-).

Refer to the data sheet and [manufacturer's installation guide](https://www.sensata.com/sites/default/files/a/sensata-pmp%20series-installation-sheet.pdf) for details.

**Note:** Some fixtures, even though they support dimming, may display slight flickering or not turn on at certain percentages, particularly less than 50% brightness.
