# Configuration: OTA Updates

Controllers and <Badge type="warning" text="TODO" /> Clients can have their firmware and UI updated over-the-air.  By default the device will check once per day, approximately at the time the device was booted, for new firmware.

If `OTA Disabled` is checked, no OTA configuration is sent for that device type.

Both `http` and `https` URLs are supported.  When `https` is used, the firmware validates the server certificate using the ESP32 core's built-in Mozilla root CA bundle by default.  If you have uploaded any certificates to the device, those are used instead of the built-in bundle.  No separate certificate selection is required.

You can configure the URL to include wildcards, which will be substituted at execution time.  The underlying library will URL encode as necessary.

| Wildcard | Example Value |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `$$pid$$` | `FFC3232-2305` |
| `$$app$$` | `FireFly Controller` |

::: info Device Identity Required
Using `$$pid$$` requires the device identity to be provisioned in eFuse.
